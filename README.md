# Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for Predicting Ciprofloxacin Resistance in UTI Patients using Machine Learning

*Predicting Ciprofloxacin Resistance using Machine Learning within a Clinical Decision Support System*

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is part of my MSc Computing Dissertation. It aims to tackle the rising challenge of antibiotic resistance, focusing specifically on predicting ciprofloxacin resistance in *Escherichia coli* for **urinary tract infections (UTIs)**.

The solution is a lightweight Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) powered by a **logistic regression model**, allowing clinicians to make data-driven decisions about antibiotic prescriptions.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🧠 Logistic Regression-based predictor for resistance  
- 📝 Form-based input system for patient data  
- 📊 SHAP-based feature importance visualization  
- 🗃️ Local SQLite database logging patient entries  
- 📈 Use Case: Supports Clinicians, GPs, and Researchers  
- 🔒 Focus on data security and integrity (developer role in system)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML (CDSS form)  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **ML**: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression), SHAP  
- **Database**: SQLite  
- **Other**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SMOTE
